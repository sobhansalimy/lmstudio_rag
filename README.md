# Mick.AI

Mick.AI is a collection of useful python scripts to do various things with AI, like local document search or synthetic data generation or custom model training.

Mick.AI is named after Mickey Goldmill, from the Rocky movies. He was a legendary trainer helping to make a fine-tuned machine. Thus, the name of this repo.

Features/Capabilities for now will be separated into top-level directories. Each feature will have its own README to explain how to use it.
